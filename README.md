# Predicting Flower Species using CNN and Transfer Learning

The project involves building a CNN classifier in order to identify the type of species of given flower image dataset. It also involves using pre-trained architecture to build the classifier. The dataset which is used for model training is oxflower17 and can be taken from tflearn.

tflearn can be installed using the below command:

```
